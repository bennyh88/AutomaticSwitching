# AutomaticSwitching
My attempt at a "simulation" of how a DNO might automatically switch substations to restore power.

Allows free placing of nodes, and free interconnecting between them. Each node is assigned a random load. 
Total load for each leg of the circuit is also calculated.
Status of the connection can be toggled between on, off, and tripped.
